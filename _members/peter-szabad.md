I am currently doing my bachelor's degree at Nord University in Bodø, Norway. I study biology with plans of completing a master's degree in marine biology. As part of my bachelor's thesis project, I will be focusing on the reproductive differences of the Canadian dwarf salmon and anadromous salmon, incorporating allometry and life histories of the two species.
