I completed my master’s degree at the University of South-Eastern Norway, where I studied the genomics of Fomitopsis pinicola, a wood decay fungus. Originally from Massachusetts, USA, I have a background in fisheries conservation and a deep appreciation for living near the ocean. My PhD research explores the molecular mechanisms underlying variation in maturity age, ovary allometry, and fecundity in Atlantic salmon. By focusing on how gene regulatory networks shape life-history strategies, this research aims to connect genetic variation with salmon development and physiology.
