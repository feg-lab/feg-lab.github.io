I earned my bachelor's degree in marine biology from Hawaii Pacific University, where my thesis explored the life history of the parrotfish Scarus oviceps through microscopic analysis of otoliths and gonads.

My spark for marine biology was ignited in Larvik, Norway, where I spent my summers fishing and diving in the local fjord, giving me a deep connection with the ocean.

My master's project investigates a previously unstudied dwarf salmon population from Watern Cove River, focusing on age at maturity and how it compares to neighboring populations. Using scale samples to determine age and targeted amplicon long-read sequencing of DNA from fin clips, we aim to uncover potential genetic differences that may explain variations in life-history traits.
