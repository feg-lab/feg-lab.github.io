I completed the MEME programme (Mobility European Master Programme in Evolutionary Biology) in 2025 where I earned my MSc in evolutionary biology from LMU Munich after having studied there, at Uppsala and most recently and at Harvard University. In my native Sweden I earned my BSc at Umeå University. During my studies I’ve gained a broad background in everything from evo-devo to phylogenetics to physiology. Ultimately what interests me is the mechanisms behind evolution, and I find fish species to be particularly suitable while trying to understand those principles. My project here at Nord University will investigate the role of certain ‘master genes’ and how they affect the great variation of life history traits we see in Atlantic salmon.
