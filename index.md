# Molecular basis of adaptive traits and evolutionary change

We are scientists at Nord University studying phenotypic diversity from the molecular to the species levels. We aim to discover the genotype-to-phenotype map for complex traits such as life histories and understand the mechanisms that influence their evolution. We focus particularly on the role of gene regulation in mediating the evolution of traits and their trade-offs.

## Highlights

Our main focus are the molecular mechanisms of variation in life history traits and trade-offs. We combine the study of natural populations with common-garden experiments, functional genomics tools and population genomic approaches. Our favourite organisms are salmonids due to their amazing diversity in adaptions and life history strategies. We're also working on the genetic basis of parallel evolution, population divergence, and genome evolution.

We mainly work on Atlantic salmon, but we've also studied diverse fishes, plants, and fungi.
