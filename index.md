# Molecular basis of adaptive traits and evolutionary change

We are a group of scientists at Nord University who want to understand the genetic mechanisms that create and maintain phenotypic diversity from the molecular to the species level. We work towards discovering the genotype-to-phenotype map for adaptive traits and the mechanisms that facilitate or constrain future adaptive evolution.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We study the molecular mechanisms of variation in life history traits. We combine the study of natural populations with common-garden experiments, functional genomics tools and population genomic approaches. Our favourite organisms are salmonids due to their amazing diversity in adaptions and life history strategies.
